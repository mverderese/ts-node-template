# TypeScript Node Template Project

This is a template for a basic TypeScript Node project with linting.

## Running the project

1. Ensure that Node is installed on your machine. This project was tested using Node version `20.12.1`. The easiest way to match Node versions is to install and use [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). If you have nodenv installed, run the following:
   ```shell
   nodenv install -s
   ```
   You can optionally update `npm` as well:
   ```shell
   npm install -g npm
   ```
2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the script
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```
